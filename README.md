# About the Project

This project explores and visualizes trends in dog names in New York City over the past ten years. By analyzing public datasets, we aim to uncover patterns, popular names, and shifts in naming preferences among dog owners. The visualizations provide insights into how cultural, social, and temporal factors influence the naming of dogs in the city.
